## About The Project

Recently, the modding community kicked off in Hardspace Shipbreaker, with a bunch of passionate individuals and hopefully more in the future we are happy to present to you mods you can easily use.

These mods have been reviewed as such to not affect RACE competitively what so ever!

Enjoy :)
